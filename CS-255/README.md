# CS-255 – Systems Analysis and Design

## Overview

This course focused on systems analysis and design using structured documentation and UML modeling. Importance was placed on gathering requirements, functional and nonfunctional requirements, and translating client needs into technical system designs. The DriverPass project demonstrates my ability to analyze business problems and design scalable, secure solutions. 

## Project One – Business Requirements

[View Business Requirements Document](./Project%20One/DriverPass_Business_Requirements.pdf)

This document defines system objectives, user roles, functional and nonfunctional requirements, security constraints, and technical limitations based on client interviews.


## Project Two – System Design

This document includes UML use case, activity, sequence, and class diagrams along with technical infrastructure planning to support implementation.

## Reflection

### Project Summary
The DriverPass project involved designing a cloud-based driver training management system for a company seeking to improve DMV test pass rates. The client required a centralized platform that allowed students to register, purchase training packages, schedule driving lessons, complete online practice exams, and track progress, while also be able to support administrative and IT roles.

### What I Did Well
I translated client interview requirements into clear functional and nonfunctional requirements and made sure to keep an alignment between documentation and UML system models. My diagrams accurately represent workflow logic and system interactions.

### What I Would Revise
If I were to revise this project, I would expand the technical infrastructure section to include deeper scalability planning and risk mitigation strategies like load balancing and disaster recovery considerations.

### Interpreting User Needs
I found core business problems like inefficient scheduling, lack of centralized access, and exam preparation challenges, and was able to translate them into structured system features. Considering user needs is very important because a technical sound system must also be usable, reliable, and aligned with business goals.

### My Approach to Designing Software
I approach system design by defining requirements first, modeling workflows and interactions using UML, and making sure that the documentation clearly communicates system behavior before implementation. In future projects, I will continue using structured modeling and iterative refinement to improve clarity and scalability.
